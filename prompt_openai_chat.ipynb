The use of AI in medical imaging, cybersecurity, feature selection, and optimization has improved accuracy, efficiency, and speed. This essay discusses the various methods used in AI image processing by analyzing scientific articles found on sciencedirect. The articles touch on several topics, including medical imaging, cybersecurity, optimization, feature selection, and sensor networks. \\n\\nMedical Imaging:\\n\\nThe use of AI in medical imaging has become increasingly popular [1][9]. AI algorithms can detect and classify different medical conditions using machine learning techniques. For instance, AI can identify large vessel occlusion (LVO) in stroke imaging, which is crucial for prompt treatment [1]. In addition, AI algorithms can detect pulmonary embolism (PE) in computed tomography (CT) scans with high accuracy [4]. The use of AI in medical imaging is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, which ensures that every clinical AI software system is treated as a medical device [1].\\n\\nCybersecurity:\\n\\nAI techniques have been used for cybersecurity purposes, such as data leakage prevention, threat intelligence, and security control validation [0][3][5][6][13][18]. AI algorithms can detect and prevent data breaches and monitor user activity to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability [0]. Threat intelligence tools can target specific languages to improve insight into cyber threats in a particular country [5]. Also, automated analysis tools can identify potential threats by analyzing the language and targets of hackers without manually monitoring the large volume of posts made on the dark web [18].\\n\\nOptimization and Feature Selection:\\n\\nAI techniques have been used for optimization and feature selection in various fields, such as fuel cells, wearable devices, and sensor networks [2][10][15][19]. For example, AI algorithms can help optimize the performance of fuel cells by using multi-physics and machine learning-based surrogate modeling approaches [2]. AI algorithms can also help optimize the edge network node for wearable devices by using a cooperative optimization algorithm [15]. Additionally, AI algorithms can help with feature selection to improve the accuracy of optimization algorithms [10][19].\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion, AI has become a valuable tool in image processing across various fields, including medical imaging, cybersecurity, optimization, feature selection, and sensor networks. AI algorithms can improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical imaging, detect and prevent data breaches, optimize the performance of various devices, and improve sensor network localization. However, future research can focus on improving the interpretability and explainability of AI algorithms to minimize constraints and improve algorithm performance [13].\",\n",
