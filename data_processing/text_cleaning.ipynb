Lou \\' work trace temperature change skin wound Bama pig healing process , result show wound temperature go three stage within two week : rise stage ( 39 ° c ) day 1 day 5 , plateau stage ( 39 - 39.5 ° c ) day 5 day 9 , fall stage ( 39 ° c ) day 9 day 14 , three stage wound temperature demonstrate associate wound biological event inflammatory , angiogenesis wound healing , respectively [ 46 ] . in addition , temperature also establish marker wound infection . without infection , temperature wound surround normal skin almost similar . a sudden temperature increase wound area ( > 2.2 ° c ) could early predictor infection obvious clinical symptom ( redness , swell smell ) occur wound site , . study prove decrease temperature decrease activity fibroblast , neutrophil , epithelial cell hinder wound healing , . thus , decrease wound temperature could indicate presence partial ischemia delay wound healing . pH . pH another important indicator wound status , significantly influence physiological process include collagen formation , inflammatory response , angiogenesis wound healing process . generally , ph normal skin heal wound slightly acidic ( ph 4 - 6 ) support proliferation fibroblast , promote angiogenesis epithelialization , increase oxygenation maintain resident commensal bacteria level [ 52 ] , . although acidic microenvironment wound might disturb neutral tissue ( ph 7.4 ) underlie skin expose , report ph value acute wound could easily return acidic level inflammation due neutrophil activity underlie event prevent bacterial colonization . additionally , although ph chronic wound usually remain alkaline ( pH 7 - 9 ) several month due ischemia - reperfusion injury cycle . the detail ph value within wound healing period acute chronic wound describe . in addition , alkaline wound vulnerable bacterial colonization infection , induce bacterial growth might increase ph level 10 . hence , monitor wound pH represent meaningful indicator predict bacterial infection estimate wound healing stage . however , current evidence indicate bacterial bioburden may cause increase wound ph . the ph value infect wound could influence type bacteria wound environment ( i.e. , anaerobic aerobic condition ) [ 20 ] . therefore , caution take use ph alone analyze wound status . a accurate diagnosis infection could make comb ph key biomarker , temperature . uric acid . uric acid ( UA ) special biomarker highly associate colonization bacteria , rapidly metabolize bacteria - synthesize uricase , . UA mainly exist wound fluid exudate form urate , vary concentration 220 750 ×10−6 m . usually , UA catabolize human body due lack specific enzyme . however , certain bacteria , Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa specifically catabolize UA bacteria - synthesize uricase , thus decrease concentration UA wind exudate 200 × 10−6 M . therefore , sharp decrease UA concentration injury site generic indicator bacterial infection . Glucose . monitor glucose level meaningful assess wound healing , especially diabetic chronic wound . the glucose concentration chronic wound fluid range 0 1.2×10−3 M . it prove high blood glucose level would interfer synthesis transcription factor hypoxia - inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) , highly express early stage normal wound healing process subsequently regulate activity cytokine cell oxygen homeostasis , thus result failure capillary blood vessel network formation tissue necrosis , . in addition , high blood glucose concentration also conduce bacterial growth [ 64 ] . thus , continuous monitoring glucose concentration injure site could reflect wound condition guide effective treatment accelerate heal diabetic wound . other Potential Markers . in addition marker , reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) level , oxygen concentration , bacterial - specific secretion also use reflect heal status wound . briefly , elevate ROS level important indicator infect chronic inflammation wound . oxygen necessary wound healing support cell proliferation , angiogenesis collagen synthesis . to specific , enough oxygen content induce migration white blood cell macrophage wound site , combat infection , promote oxidative metabolism deliver growth factor accelerate wound healing , hypoxia hinder repair process .The continuous monitoring oxygen concentration wound bed provide timely oxygen supplement guideline wound management . lastly , biochemical by - product secrete bacteria wound site use detect bacteria directly . for instance , Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain secret pyocyanin , Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa secret special toxin phospholipase A2 a - hemolysin , . the status wound healing evaluate numerical change abovementione physiological signal early alert wound lesion . it worth note biomarker react strongly target wound lesion need first select repeatedly measure achieve accurate diagnosis . moreover , monitor single physiological signal may lead undiscerne evaluation wound status . sometimes , multiple related biomarker monitor together comprehensively evaluate ensure optimal diagnosis conclusion . 3 . approach monitor biomarker base different mechanism in clinic , standard evaluation step wound - relate biomarker wound status include remove cover wound dressing , observe take swab wound site , follow series laboratory analysis , time - consume might lead misdiagnosis real wound status . moreover , frequently remove wound dressing could disrupt normal healing process cause pain patient . in recent year , advanced sense technology read wound biomarker convert related information visual electrochemical datum widely develop . integrate sensor wound dress achieve situ monitoring wound status , accelerate decision - make process intervention treatment , prevent unnecessary dressing change , reduce treatment cost , time , hospital resource . in addition , development state - of - the - art wearable technology integrate microelectronic sensor , microprocessor wireless communication also make possible real - time remote monitoring wound status . the follow section disscusse biomarker ’ detection optical ( colorimetric fluorimetric ) electrochemical approach , wearable sensor fabricate different material correspond performance comparison wound biomarker detection summarize . by — brilliant yellow ; CJ — cabbage juice ; GA — gentamicin ; pr — phenol red ; GOx — gucose oxidase ; HRP — horseradish peroxidase ; H2DCF—2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin ; PCB — poly - carboxybetaine ; RFID — radio frequency deification ; MB — methylene blue ; PVA — polyvinyl alcohol ; CMC — carboxymethylcellulose ; NS — not specify ; CF — carboxyfluorescein ; TCDA—10,12 - tricosadiynosic acid ; SNP — Silicon nanoparticle ; ucnp — up - conversion nanoparticle ; FRTE — fluorescence resonance energy transfer ; PAN — polyacrylonitrile ; eucps — europium - base coordination polymer ; PANI — polyaniline ; PB — prussian blue ; NFC — near - field communication ; NFC — near - field communication ; Mg — magnesium ; c - PNHM — poly ( N - isopropyl acrylamide - co - n - methylol acrylamide ) ; PAM — polyacrylamide ; SBMA — zwitterionic carboxyl betaine ; PNIPAAm — poly ( N - isopropyl acrylamide ) . 3.1 . biomarker detection optical approach optical detection approach biomarker include colorimetric fluorimetric method . colorimetric detection approach usually achieve incorporate sensitive dye change color base wound status , simple , intuitive , low cost allow large - scale integration various dressing [ 70 ] , . the detection result approach read image acquisition colorimetric analysis color change even distinguish naked eye , induce fast estimation wound status . currently , already - develop colorimetric method mainly apply detect wound fluid ph bacteria base pH - sensitive bacterial - sensitive dye .
